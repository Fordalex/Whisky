            <br><strong>Process:</strong> Produced at a single distillery. The barley is malted (soaked, germinated, and dried), mashed with hot water, fermented with yeast, distilled in pot stills, and aged in oak barrels for at least three years.
            <br><strong>Steps:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malting:</strong> Barley is soaked, germinated, and dried, often using peat smoke for flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Mashing:</strong> Malted barley is mixed with hot water to extract fermentable sugars, producing "wort."</li>
                <li><strong>Fermentation:</strong> Yeast is added to the wort, converting sugars into alcohol, creating "wash."</li>
                <li><strong>Distillation:</strong> The wash is distilled twice in copper pot stills to concentrate alcohol and flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Whisky is matured in oak barrels (often ex-bourbon or sherry casks), developing flavor over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Flavor Profile:</strong> Complex, with regional influences like fruity (Speyside), peaty (Islay), or floral (Highlands).
